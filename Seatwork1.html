             <td style="background-color: lightblue;">A medium-sized compact sled dog with a thick coat and excellent endurance. Siberian Huskies were developed to move in packs and carry light loads across large icy terrain at moderate speeds. Brothers are kind, demanding and dignified. The graceful, medium-sized Siberian Husky's almond-shaped eyes can be brown or blue, sometimes both, giving it a sharp yet affable and mischievous look. Fast and light on their feet, Siberians are known for their powerful yet seemingly effortless gait. They tip the scales at under 60 pounds and are noticeably smaller and lighter than their stocky cousin the Alaskan Malamute. Born as a pack dog, they enjoy family life and get along well with other dogs. The Sibe's innate friendliness makes them indifferent watchdogs. These are energetic dogs who can't stand chasing small animals, so a safe running area is a must.Attractive traits of this breed:Sieves are naturally clean and have very little dog odor.

             <td style="background-color: lightblue;">The Akita is a big, strong dog breed with a proud, commanding presence. In feudal Japan, they were initially employed to protect nobility and monarchy. Along with tracking and hunting deer, these dogs occasionally hunted wild boar and black bear.
             The Akita does not back down from difficulties and does not readily become frightened. They are hence fearless and devoted protectors of their families. But when trained and socialized properly, they can also be loving, obedient, and humurous dogs</td>
